### How to use

Navigate through the website to locate the code for the four specifications.

### Specification 3

In this challenge you are going to build a web application using a
Python-based web framework. Flask is a common web framework that is
easy to setup and allows extensibility.

You are going to build a simple web application that presents the code
written in the previous challenge specifications. The purpose of the
webpages is to present the code neatly with some brief documentation
explaining the purpose of the code. What you do here is entirely
experimental and open for creativity, therefore you can make use of
any external libraries for the presentation of your code. However, be
sure not to 'feature creep'.

This challenge is about your ability to investigate a Python web
framework library and its applications rather than your HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript abilities. I suggest looking through my guide on creating a
simple web application that uses HTML templates.

Do **not** host your web application on a public server.

#### Objectives

* Install the Python web-framework Flask.
* Produce a simple home page that links/routes to other pages that
  display your code.
* Produce a web page for each of the other specifications and present
  your code on them.
* Produce a brief description explaining what the code does and how it
  meets the objective of the specification.

#### Learning Outcomes

* To be able to investigate a library's documentation page to produce
  code that satisfies an objective.
* To understand the application of Python in web-based development and
  deployment.
* To understand how Python can be used to create fast and simple web
  applications.

#### Concepts to consider

* String manipulation
* File IO
* Templating of HTML files
* Passing of arguments

#### Libraries to investigate

* [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html)
