Assessment one reads through a textfile and displays several graphs; this includes number of each letter and the
number of each punctuation symbol. Graphs are output using the matplotlib library. The program can be used on any
textfile required. This meets the objectives of the specification as the application can read through a textfile,
perform the neccasary calculations throughout various loops, and then output the results on bar charts using the
MatPlotLib library, as well as producing a Markdown file.

Objectives:
- Read in a .txt file and parse the content.
- Perform a frequency analysis of the characters and words in the text file.
- Output the frequency of the most occurring words in the text file to a CSV file.
- Present your frequency analysis of the characters visually using the Matplotlib plotting library.
- Produce a Markdown file in your repository directory that combines your findings in one place.
