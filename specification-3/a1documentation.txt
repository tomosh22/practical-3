Assessment one reads through a textfile and displays several graphs; this includes number of each letter and the
number of each punctuation symbol. Graphs are output using the matplotlib library. The program can be used on any
textfile required.

Objectives:
• Read in a .txt file and parse the content.
• Perform a frequency analysis of the characters and words in the text file.
• Output the frequency of the most occurring words in the text file to a CSV file.
• Present your frequency analysis of the characters visually using the Matplotlib plotting library.
• Produce a Markdown file in your repository directory that combines your findings in one place.
