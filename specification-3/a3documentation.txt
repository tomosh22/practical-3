This is the website code which is based around using the flask library. It involves using one template across four
pages (assessments) which each have small variations which are managed using variables. Code and documentation are read
from textfiles rather than being stored within the program. Trying to store code within a string caused the program to
break and documentation became very messy due to being indented, so was being split as quite a lot of different strings.

Objectives:
• Install the Python web-framework Flask.
• Produce a simple home page that links/routes to other pages that display your code.
• Produce a web page for each of the other specifications and present your code on them.
• Produce a brief description explaining what the code does and how it meets the objective of the specification.
