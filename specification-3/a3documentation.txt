This is the website code which is based around using the flask library. It involves using one template across four
pages (assessments) which each have small variations which are managed using variables. Code and documentation are read
from textfiles rather than being stored within the program. Trying to store code within a string caused the program to
break and documentation became very messy due to being indented, so was being split as quite a lot of different strings.

Objectives :
Install the Python web-framework Flask.
    Flask was used to create the website
Produce a simple home page that links/routes to other pages that display your code.
    Has a home page, and each page can link to every other page.
Produce a web page for each of the other specifications and present your code on them.
    Has four pages, each showing the code of their respective assessments
Produce a brief description explaining what the code does and how it meets the objective of the specification
    This is a brief description explaining how each objective has been met.
