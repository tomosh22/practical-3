### Specification 1

In this challenge you are going to be exploring frequency analysis of
large text files and producing a visual way of presenting your
analysis results. Write a program that takes a large text file and
perform a frequency analysis of the characters and words in that
file. You should then present your findings visually using the python
2D graph plotting library, Matplotlib.

#### Objectives

* Read in a *.txt* file and parse the content.
* Perform a frequency analysis of the characters and words in the text
  file.
* Output the frequency of the most occurring words in the text file to
  a CSV file.
* Present your frequency analysis of the characters visually using the
  Matplotlib plotting library.
* Produce a Markdown file in your repository directory that combines
  your findings in one place.

#### Learning Outcomes

* To be able to investigate a libraries' documentation page to produce
  code that satisfies an objective.
* To be able to handle the reading and writing of files.
* To investigate suitable methods of analysing large quantities of
  text.
* To learn how to present your findings visually, so that someone else
  can understand your findings.

#### Concepts to consider

* File IO
* Collections
* String Manipulation
* Sorting methods

#### Libraries to investigate

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
